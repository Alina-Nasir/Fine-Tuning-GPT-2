## Fine-Tuning GPT-2 for Story Generation
### Project Overview
This project involved fine-tuning a GPT-2 model on a dataset of writing prompts for story generation. The process aimed to enhance the GPT-2 model's ability to generate coherent and creative stories based on given prompts.
### Data Preperation
  - Collect Dataset: Gather a dataset of writing prompts and corresponding stories.
  - Pre-process Data: Clean the dataset by removing unwanted tokens, normalizing text, and ensuring consistency in formatting.
#### Fine-Tuning Steps
#### 1. Tokenization
Convert the text data into tokens that the GPT-2 model can understand using a pre-trained tokenizer.
#### 2. Model Setup
   - Load a pre-trained GPT-2 model.
   - Configure the model with appropriate hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, etc.).
#### 3. Fine-Tuning Process
#### Training Loop
   - Forward Pass: Input tokenized text into the model to obtain predictions.
   - Compute Loss: Calculate the loss between the predicted tokens and the actual tokens.
   - Backward Pass: Perform backpropagation to update the model weights.
   - Optimization: Adjust the weights using an optimization algorithm (e.g., Adam).
#### 4. Evaluation
   - Generate Stories: Use the fine-tuned GPT-2 model to generate stories based on new writing prompts.
   - Evaluate Quality: Assess the generated stories for accuracy, coherence, creativity, and relevance to the prompts.
     - Automated Metrics: Evaluate using automated metrics like perplexity or BLEU scores.
     - Human Evaluation: Conduct human evaluation to rate the quality of the generated stories.
#### 5. Post-Processing
   - Refine Output: Optionally post-process the generated stories to correct any grammatical errors or improve readability.
   - Iterate: Based on evaluation feedback, iterate on the fine-tuning process to further improve model performance.

By following these fine-tuning steps, the GPT-2 model was adapted to generate high-quality, coherent stories from writing prompts, demonstrating its capability to understand and creatively extend given inputs. The generated stories were evaluated for accuracy and coherence, ensuring the model's improved ability to produce compelling narrative content.
